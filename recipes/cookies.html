<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Not just an ordinary cookie. When your guests eat these cookies, they will open up and tell you everything you need to know. All it takes is just one byte!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>500 bits of information</li>
    <li>2 files with JavaScript</li>
    <li>Handful of attributes</li>
    <li>20 unrestricted POST requests</li>
    <li>1 large third party server</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups user behavior tracking </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (28g) online marketing, optional</li>
    <li class="stand-out">A cookie jar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease two baking sheets, or line with parchment.</li>
    <li>Beat together the bits of information, JavaScript, attributes and unrestricted POST requests till well combined.</li>
    <li>Add the third party server, beating till smooth. Scrape the sides of the bowl, and beat again till smooth.</li>
    <li>Add the user behavior tracking, mixing it in completely.</li>
    <li>If you're making cookies using chips, transistors, etc, beat in the online marketing, then the add-ins.</li>
    <li>If you're making plain cookies, without add-ins, omit the online marketing.</li>
    <li>Drop the cookies by the traditional "tablespoonful" (actually about 4 measuring teaspoons) onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2" apart. A tablespoon cookie scoop works well here.</li>
    <li>Bake the cookies for 10 to 14 minutes (or up to 16 minutes; ovens may vary). The cookies should be a light golden brown, and a bit darker around the edges. For softer cookies, bake the shorter amount of time; for crunchy cookies, bake longer.</li>
    <li>Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the baking sheets.</li>
</ol>
